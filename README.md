## Quick Start

In order to use the application you should first navigate to the client folder with your terminal and then install the packages and dependecies of the project and later on you can run the application by using the following commands:

```
  npm install
  npm run dev
```


## HTML

There are two html pages in this application. One of the is called of course the index.html file which is the main thing that will be diplayed upon running the application. And the second file is game.html which contains the game graphics.

## CSS

Like it was mentioned above, we have only two html files in this relateively small project. For each html file a corresponding css file has been created also. At the end of each css file we have some media queries to help the application to be playable on a smaller device let's say a mobile phone. The css files are located in src/css/ folder.
